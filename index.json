	"content": "The Image Tool installer is available for download on the Releases page. If you want to build the installer from source instead of downloading it, follow these instructions:\n Download and install JDK 8u261+. Download and install Maven 3.6.3+. Clone this repository to your local environment.  Cloning options are shown under the Code button at the root of this project. For example, git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool.git.   From inside the top-level directory of the cloned project, weblogic-image-tool, using Maven, execute one or more of these phases:  validate - Validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available. compile - Compile the source code. test - Test the compiled source code using the JUnit5 framework. package - Create the installer ZIP file, imagetool.zip. verify - Run integration tests using the JUnit5 framework (Prerequisite: Docker installed). clean - Restore the source by removing any items created by package or another phase of the build.    Note: Maven executes build phases sequentially, validate, compile, test, package, verify, such that running verify will run all of these phases from validate through package before running verify.\nBecause the package phase comes before the verify phase, it is not necessary to run the integration tests to create the Image Tool installer. If you are making changes and want to validate those changes in your environment, you will need to do some additional setup before running the verify phase because several of the integration tests require access to the Oracle Technology Network. To run the integration tests in the verify phase, you must specify three environment variables, ORACLE_SUPPORT_USERNAME, ORACLE_SUPPORT_PASSWORD, and STAGING_DIR. The first two, Oracle Support user name and password, are used to connect to Oracle OTN for patches. The third, STAGING_DIR, should be a local folder where WebLogic Server installers, JDK installers, and pre-downloaded patches can be found. The files required in the STAGING_DIR depend on which tests that you want to run.\nExample: Run a set of integration tests (available groups are cache, gate, and nightly:\n$ mvn verify -Dtest.groups=cache Example: Run a single integration test:\n$ mvn verify -Dtest.groups=gate,nightly -Dit.test=ITImagetool#createWlsImg Integration Test groups:\n cache - Tests that build and manipulate the Image Tool cache. gate - A basic set of integration tests that are used to validate merge requests, including building several Docker image (~20 minutes). nightly - The full set of integration tests building various container images including JRF and WLS installations (~2 hours).  Note: In order to run an integration test that builds an image like createWlsImg, you must run the cache group first to populate the cache with the WLS and JDK installers.\n"

Valid sections for create are:\n   Section Build Stage Timing     package-manager-packages All A list of OS packages, such as ftp gzip, separated by line or space.   before-jdk-install Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) Before the JDK is installed.   after-jdk-install Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) After the JDK is installed.   before-fmw-install Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) Before the Oracle Home is created.   after-fmw-install Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) After all of the Oracle middleware installers are finished.   before-wdt-command Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) Before WDT is installed.   after-wdt-command Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) After WDT domain creation/update is complete.   final-build-commands Final image After all Image Tool actions are complete, and just before the container image is finalized.    NOTE: Changes made in intermediate stages may not be carried forward to the final image unless copied manually.\nThe Image Tool will copy the Java Home, Oracle Home, domain home, and WDT home directories to the final image.\nChanges fully contained within these directories do not need an additional COPY command in the final-build-commands section.\nEach section can contain one or more valid Dockerfile commands and would look like the following:\n[after-fmw-install]RUN rm /some/dir/unnecessary-fileCOPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/my_additional_file.txt /u01[final-build-commands]LABEL owner=\u0026#34;middleware team\u0026#34;--additionalBuildFiles This option provides a way to supply additional files to the image build command. All provided files and directories are copied directly under the files subfolder of the build context.\nTo get those files into the image, additional build commands must be provided using the additionalBuildCommands options. Access to these files using a build command, such as COPY or ADD, should use the original filename with the folder prefix, files/. For example, if the original file was provided as --additionalBuildFiles /scratch/test1/convenience.sh, the Docker build command COPY provided in --additionalBuildCommands should look like COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/convenience.sh /my/internal/image/location.\nBecause Image Tool uses multi-stage builds, it is important to place the build command (like COPY) in the appropriate section of the Dockerfile based on when the build needs access to the file. For example, if the file is needed in the final image and not for installation or domain creation steps, use the final-build-commands section so that the COPY command occurs in the final stage of the image build. Or, if the file needs to change the Oracle Home prior to domain creation, use the after-fmw-install or before-wdt-command sections.\n--target By default, the generated WLS domain in your image will use the best practices defined by Oracle WebLogic Server.\nThe target option allows you to toggle the defaults so that the generated domain is easier to use in the target environment. For example, the --target OpenShift option will change the file permissions in the domain directory so that the group permissions match the user permissions.\n   Target Default File Permissions Default File Ownership     Default rwxr-x--- oracle:oracle   OpenShift rwxrwx--- oracle:root    Resource Template Files If provided, the file or files provided with --resourceTemplates will be overwritten. For known tokens, the placeholders will be replaced with values according to the following table.\nNote: Placeholders must follow the Mustache syntax, like {{imageName}} or {{{imageName}}}.\n   Token Name Value Description     domainHome The value provided to the Image Tool with --wdtDomainHome.   domainHomeSourceType PersistentVolume (default), FromModel if --wdtModelOnly, or Image if the domain is created in the image with WDT.   imageName The value provided to the Image Tool with --tag.   modelHome The value provided to the Image Tool with --wdtModelHome.    Use an argument file You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.\nFor example, create a file called build_args:\ncreate --type wls --version 12.2.1.3.0 --tag wls:122130 --user acmeuser@mycompany.com --httpProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80 --httpsProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80 --passwordEnv MYPWD Use it on the command line, as follows:\n$ imagetool @/path/to/build_args Usage scenarios Note: Use --passwordEnv or --passwordFile instead of --password.\nThe following commands assume that all the required JDK, WLS, or FMW (WebLogic infrastructure) installers have been downloaded to the cache directory. Use the cache command to set it up.\n  Create an image named sample:wls with the WebLogic installer 12.2.1.3.0, server JDK 8u202, and latest PSU applied.\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:wls --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello   Create an image named sample:wdt with the same options as above and create a domain with WebLogic Deploy Tooling.\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:wdt --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --wdtModel /path/to/model.json --wdtVariables /path/to/variables.json --wdtVersion 0.16 If wdtVersion is not provided, the tool uses the latest release.\n  Create an image named sample:patch with the selected patches applied.\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:patch --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --patches 12345678,p87654321 The patch numbers may or may not start with \u0026lsquo;p\u0026rsquo;.\n  "

Valid sections for rebase:\n   Section Build Stage Timing     before-jdk-install Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) Before the JDK is installed.   after-jdk-install Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) After the JDK is installed.   before-fmw-install Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) Before the Oracle Home is created.   after-fmw-install Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) After all of the Oracle middleware installers are finished.   final-build-commands Final image After all Image Tool actions are complete, and just before the container image is finalized.    NOTE: Changes made in intermediate stages may not be carried forward to the final image unless copied manually.\nThe Image Tool will copy the Java Home and the Oracle Home directories to the final image.\nChanges fully contained within these directories do not need an additional COPY command in the final-build-commands section. Each section can contain one or more valid Dockerfile commands and would look like the following:\n[after-fmw-install]RUN rm /some/dir/unnecessary-fileCOPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/my_additional_file.txt /u01[final-build-commands]LABEL owner=\u0026#34;middleware team\u0026#34;--additionalBuildFiles This option provides a way to supply additional files to the image build command. All provided files and directories are copied directly under the files subfolder of the build context.\nTo get those files into the image, additional build commands must be provided using the additionalBuildCommands options. Access to these files using a build command, such as COPY or ADD, should use the original filename with the folder prefix, files/. For example, if the original file was provided as --additionalBuildFiles /scratch/test1/convenience.sh, the Docker build command COPY provided in --additionalBuildCommands should look like COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/convenience.sh /my/internal/image/location.\nBecause Image Tool uses multi-stage builds, it is important to place the build command (like COPY) in the appropriate section of the Dockerfile based on when the build needs access to the file. For example, if the file is needed in the final image and not for installation or domain creation steps, use the final-build-commands section so that the COPY command occurs in the final stage of the image build. Or, if the file needs to change the Oracle Home prior to domain creation, use the after-fmw-install or before-wdt-command sections.\n--target By default, the generated WLS domain in your image will use the best practices defined by Oracle WebLogic Server.\nThe target option allows you to toggle the defaults so that the generated domain is easier to use in the target environment. For example, the --target OpenShift option will change the file permissions in the domain directory so that the group permissions match the user permissions.\n   Target Default File Permissions Default File Ownership     Default rwxr-x--- oracle:oracle   OpenShift rwxrwx--- oracle:root    Use an argument file You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.\nFor example, create a file called build_args:\nrebase --tag wls:122140 --sourceImage wls:122130 --version 12.2.1.4.0 --jdkVersion 8u221 Use it on the command line, as follows:\n$ imagetool @/path/to/build_args Usage scenarios Note: Use --passwordEnv or --passwordFile instead of --password.\nThe commands below assume that all the required JDK, WLS, or FMW (WebLogic infrastructure) installers have been downloaded to the cache directory. Use the cache command to set it up.\n  Update the JDK for an existing domain. Copy the existing domain from sample:v1 where the JDK was 8u202 to a new image called sample:v2 and install the newer JDK 8u221 with WebLogic Server 12.2.1.3.0.\n$ imagetool rebase --tag sample:v2 --sourceImage sample:v1 --version 12.2.1.3.0 --jdkVersion 8u221   Update the Oracle Home for an existing domain with a newer WebLogic version. Copy a domain from an existing image to a new image with a new install of WebLogic Server 12.2.1.4.0. Copy the domain from sample:v1 and select the desired WebLogic installer using the --version argument.\n$ imagetool rebase --tag sample:v2 --sourceImage sample:v1 --version 12.2.1.4.0 --jdkVersion 8u221   Update the JDK and/or Oracle Home for an existing domain using another image with pre-installed binaries. Copy the domain from the source image named sample:v1 to a new image called sample:v2 based on a target image named fmw:12214. Note: The Oracle Home and JDK must be installed in the same same folders on each image.\n$ imagetool rebase --tag sample:v2 --sourceImage sample:v1 --targetImage fmw:12214   "

This store is used to look up where the Java, WebLogic Server installers, and WebLogic Server patches reside in the local file system.\nBy default, the cache store is located in the user\u0026rsquo;s $HOME/cache directory. Under this directory, the lookup information is stored in the .metadata file. All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory.\nYou can change the default cache store location by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR:\n$ export WLSIMG_CACHEDIR=\u0026#34;/path/to/cachedir\u0026#34; You use the cache command to manipulate the local file cache.

	"content": "WebLogic Image Tool Oracle is finding ways for organizations using WebLogic Server to run important workloads, to move those workloads into the cloud, and to simplify and speed up the application deployment life cycle. By adopting industry standards, such as Docker and Kubernetes, WebLogic now runs in a cloud neutral infrastructure. To help simplify and automate the creation of container images for WebLogic Server, we are providing this open source WebLogic Image Tool (WIT).\nWIT let\u0026rsquo;s you create a new Linux based image, with installations of a JDK and WebLogic Server, and optionally, configure a WebLogic domain with your applications, apply WebLogic Server patches, or update an existing image.\nWith the Image Tool you can:\n Create a container image and install the requested Java and WebLogic software. And, you can create a WebLogic domain in the image, at the same time. Create a new container image using an existing WebLogic domain from an existing image. The Docker image can start from an existing image with a JDK and Oracle middleware installation, or can install the JDK and Oracle Home as part of moving the domain. Create a new container image by applying WebLogic patches to an existing image. In addition, if one did not exist previously, you can create a WebLogic domain, update an existing domain, or deploy an application.  For detailed information, see Image Tool.\n Current production release WebLogic Image Tool version and release information can be found here.\n Recent changes and known issues See the Release Notes for issues and important information.\nAbout this documentation  Use the Quick Start guide to create a Linux based WebLogic container image. The User Guide contains detailed usage information, including command options and usage scenarios. The Samples provide typical and informative use cases. The Developer Guide provides details for people who want to understand how WIT is built. Those who wish to contribute to the WebLogic Image Tool code will find useful information here.
