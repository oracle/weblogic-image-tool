    "content": "The create command helps build a WebLogic container image from a given base OS image. There are a number of optional parameters for this feature. The required option for the command is marked in the following table.\nNOTE: The WebLogic Image Tool does not support a Stack Patch Bundle (SPB; see Doc ID 2764636.1 ), because an SPB is not a patch but a mechanism for applying all PSU and recommended CPU and SPU patches to a WebLogic Server installation, similar to invoking the Image Tool create command with the --recommendedPatches option.\nUsage: imagetool create [OPTIONS] Parameter Definition Default --tag (Required) Tag for the final build image. Example: store/oracle/weblogic:14.1.2.0.0 --additionalBuildCommands Path to a file with additional build commands. For more details, see Additional information . --additionalBuildFiles Additional files that are required by your additionalBuildCommands. A comma separated list of files that should be copied to the build context. See Additional information . --builder, -b Executable to process the Dockerfile. Use the full path of the executable if not on your path. Defaults to docker, or, when set, to the value in environment variable WLSIMG_BUILDER. --buildNetwork Networking mode for the RUN instructions during the image build. See --network for Docker build. --chown userid:groupid to be used for creating files within the image, such as the JDK, the FMW/WLS installs, etc. If the user or group does not exist in the image, they will be added with useradd/groupadd. oracle:oracle --docker (DEPRECATED) Path to the Docker executable. Use --builder instead. docker --dryRun Skip Docker build execution and print the Dockerfile to stdout. --fromImage Container image to use as a base image when creating a new image. ghcr.io/oracle/oraclelinux:8-slim --fromImageProperties Properties that describe the --fromImage. If not provided, docker run will be used to inspect the --fromImage image. See Custom Base Images --httpProxyUrl Proxy for the HTTP protocol.

Supported values: linux/amd64 or linux/arm64. --pull Always attempt to pull a newer version of base images during the build. --recommendedPatches Find and apply the latest PatchSet Update and recommended patches. This takes precedence over --latestPSU. --resourceTemplates One or more files containing placeholders that need to be resolved by the Image Tool. See Resource Template Files . --skipcleanup Do not delete the build context folder, intermediate images, and failed build containers. For debugging purposes. --strictPatchOrdering Instruct OPatch to apply patches one at a time (uses apply instead of napply). --target Select the target environment in which the created image will be used. Supported values: Default (Docker/Kubernetes), OpenShift. See Additional information . Default --type Installer type. Supported values: WLS, WLSDEV, WLSSLIM, FMW, IDM, MFT, OAM, ODI, OHS, OIG, OUD, OUD_WLS, OID, OSB, SOA, SOA_OSB, SOA_OSB_B2B, WCC, WCP, WCS WLS --useBuildx Use BuildKit for building the container image. --user Oracle support email ID. When supplying user, you must supply the password either as an environment variable using --passwordEnv, or as a file using --passwordFile, or interactively, on the command line with --password. --version Installer version. 14.1.2.0.0 --wdtArchive A WDT archive ZIP file or comma-separated list of files. --wdtDomainHome Path to the -domain_home for WDT. /u01/domains/base_domain --wdtDomainType WDT domain type. Supported values: WLS, JRF, RestrictedJRF WLS --wdtEncryptionKey Passphrase for WDT -use_encryption that will be requested on STDIN. --wdtEncryptionKeyEnv Passphrase for WDT -use_encryption that is provided as an environment variable. --wdtEncryptionKeyFile Passphrase for WDT -use_encryption that is provided as a file. --wdtHome The target folder in the image for the WDT install and models. /u01/wdt --wdtJavaOptions Java command-line options for WDT. --wdtModel A WDT model file or a comma-separated list of files. --wdtModelHome The target location in the image to copy WDT model, variable, and archive files. {wdtHome}/models --wdtModelOnly Install WDT and copy the models to the image, but do not create the domain. false --wdtRunRCU Instruct WDT to run RCU when creating the domain. --wdtStrictValidation Use strict validation for the WDT validation method. Only applies when using model only. false --wdtVariables A WDT variables file or comma-separated list of files. --wdtVersion WDT version to use. latest Additional information --additionalBuildCommands This is an advanced option that let’s you provide additional commands to the Docker build step.\nThe input for this parameter is a simple text file that contains one or more of the valid sections. Valid sections for create are:\nSection Available Variables Build Stage Timing initial-build-commands None All As root, and before any Image Tool actions. package-manager-packages None All A list of OS packages, such as ftp gzip, separated by line or space. before-jdk-install JAVA_HOME Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) Before the JDK is installed. after-jdk-install JAVA_HOME Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) After the JDK is installed. before-fmw-install JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) Before the Oracle Home is created. after-fmw-install JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) After all of the Oracle middleware installers are finished. before-wdt-command DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) Before WDT is installed. after-wdt-command DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) After WDT domain creation/update is complete. final-build-commands JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Final image After all Image Tool actions are complete, and just before the container image is finalized. DOMAIN_HOME is only available if WDT was used during the build. NOTE: Changes made in intermediate stages may not be carried forward to the final image unless copied manually.\nThe Image Tool will copy the Java Home, Oracle Home, domain home, and WDT home directories to the final image.\nChanges fully contained within these directories do not need an additional COPY command in the final-build-commands section.\nEach section can contain one or more valid Dockerfile commands and would look like the following:\n[after-fmw-install] RUN rm /some/dir/unnecessary-file COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/my_additional_file.txt /u01 [final-build-commands] LABEL owner=\"middleware team\" --additionalBuildFiles This option provides a way to supply additional files to the image build command. All provided files and directories are copied directly under the files subfolder of the build context.\nTo get those files into the image, additional build commands must be provided using the additionalBuildCommands options. Access to these files using a build command, such as COPY or ADD, should use the original filename with the folder prefix, files/. For example, if the original file was provided as --additionalBuildFiles /scratch/test1/convenience.sh, the Docker build command COPY provided in --additionalBuildCommands should look like COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/convenience.sh /my/internal/image/location.\nBecause Image Tool uses multi-stage builds, it is important to place the build command (like COPY) in the appropriate section of the Dockerfile based on when the build needs access to the file. For example, if the file is needed in the final image and not for installation or domain creation steps, use the final-build-commands section so that the COPY command occurs in the final stage of the image build. Or, if the file needs to change the Oracle Home prior to domain creation, use the after-fmw-install or before-wdt-command sections.\nUsing OpenShift --target By default, the installed middleware will default file permissions to rwxr-x---.\nThe target option allows you to toggle the defaults so that the generated domain is easier to use in the target environment. For example, the --target OpenShift option will change the file permissions in the domain directory so that the group permissions match the user permissions.\nTarget Default File Permissions Default File Ownership Default rwxr-x--- oracle:oracle OpenShift rwxrwx--- oracle:root Custom Base Images --fromImageProperties When specifying --fromImage to override the default base image, Image Tool needs additional information about the image that is being provided, such as the installed operating system and version. By default, the additional information is gathered automatically by the Image Tool using docker run. If it is desirable to provide that additional information manually and avoid the docker run step, --fromImageProperties must be provided with the additional information using a Java Properties file. The file must be a line-oriented format with key-value pairs separated by =. For example:\npackageManager=MICRODNF __OS__ID=\"ol\" __OS__VERSION=\"8.10\" Required properties:\nKey Description Default packageManager The name of the installed package manager in the fromImage in all CAPS. Like DNF, MICRODNF, and YUM YUM __OS__ID The ID value found in /etc/os-release. Like “ol” for Oracle Linux, or “bb” for BusyBox. __OS__VERSION The VERSION value found in /etc/os-release. Like “8.10”. Additional properties:\nKey Description javaHome The location where the JDK is pre-installed. Like “/u01/jdk”. __OS__arch The output of uname -m. Like amd64 or arm64. Resource Template Files If provided, the file or files provided with --resourceTemplates will be overwritten. For known tokens, the placeholders will be replaced with values according to the following table.\nNote: Placeholders must follow the Mustache syntax, like {{imageName}} or {{{imageName}}}.\nToken Name Value Description domainHome The value provided to the Image Tool with --wdtDomainHome. domainHomeSourceType PersistentVolume (default), FromModel if --wdtModelOnly, or Image if the domain is created in the image with WDT. imageName The value provided to the Image Tool with --tag. modelHome The value provided to the Image Tool with --wdtModelHome. Use an argument file You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.\nFor example, create a file called build_args:\ncreate --type wls --version 14.1.2.0.0 --tag wls:141200 --user acmeuser@mycompany.com --httpProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80 --httpsProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80 --passwordEnv MYPWD Use it on the command line, as follows:\n$ imagetool @/path/to/build_args Usage scenarios The following commands assume that all the required JDK, WLS, or FMW (WebLogic infrastructure) installers have been downloaded to the cache directory. Use the cache command to set it up.\nCreate an image named sample:wls with the WebLogic installer 14.1.2.0.0, server JDK 21.0.6, and latest PSU applied.\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:wls --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello Create an image named sample:wdt with the same options as above and create a domain with WebLogic Deploy Tooling .\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:wdt --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --wdtModel /path/to/model.json --wdtVariables /path/to/variables.json --wdtVersion 0.16 If wdtVersion is not provided, the tool uses the latest release.\nCreate an image named sample:patch with the selected patches applied.\n$ imagetool create --tag sample:patch --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --patches 12345678,p87654321 The patch numbers may or may not start with ‘p’.",

    "content": "The Image Tool installer is available for download on the Releases page. If you want to build the installer from source instead of downloading it, follow these instructions:\nDownload and install JDK 8u261+. Download and install Maven 3.6.3+. Clone this repository to your local environment. Cloning options are shown under the Code button at the root of this project. For example, git clone https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool.git. From inside the top-level directory of the cloned project, weblogic-image-tool, using Maven, execute one or more of these phases: validate - Validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available. compile - Compile the source code. test - Test the compiled source code using the JUnit5 framework. package - Create the installer ZIP file, imagetool.zip. verify - Run integration tests using the JUnit5 framework (Prerequisite: Docker installed). clean - Restore the source by removing any items created by package or another phase of the build. Note: Maven executes build phases sequentially, validate, compile, test, package, verify, such that running verify will run all of these phases from validate through package before running verify.\nBecause the package phase comes before the verify phase, it is not necessary to run the integration tests to create the Image Tool installer. If you are making changes and want to validate those changes in your environment, you will need to do some additional setup before running the verify phase because several of the integration tests require access to the Oracle Technology Network. To run the integration tests in the verify phase, you must specify three environment variables, ORACLE_SUPPORT_USERNAME, ORACLE_SUPPORT_PASSWORD, and STAGING_DIR. The first two, Oracle Support user name and password, are used to connect to Oracle OTN for patches. The third, STAGING_DIR, should be a local folder where WebLogic Server installers, JDK installers, and pre-downloaded patches can be found. The files required in the STAGING_DIR depend on which tests that you want to run.\nExample: Run a set of integration tests (available groups are cache, gate, and nightly:\n$ mvn verify -Dtest.groups=cache Example: Run a single integration test:\n$ mvn verify -Dtest.groups=gate,nightly -Dit.test=ITImagetool#createWlsImg Integration Test groups:\ncache - Tests that build and manipulate the Image Tool cache. gate - A basic set of integration tests that are used to validate merge requests, including building several Docker image (~20 minutes). nightly - The full set of integration tests building various container images including JRF and WLS installations (~2 hours). Note: In order to run an integration test that builds an image like createWlsImg, you must run the cache group first to populate the cache with the WLS and JDK installers.",

For example, if the file is needed in the final image and not for installation or domain creation steps, use the final-build-commands section so that the COPY command occurs in the final stage of the image build.\nUsing OpenShift --target The file permissions in the Auxiliary image should match the container image where WebLogic Server is installed. The target option is supplied for Auxiliary images as a convenience to simplify creating images with the same owner:group file permissions. Use the same value for --target when creating images with create and createAuxImage.\nTarget Default File Permissions Default File Ownership Default rwxr-x--- oracle:oracle OpenShift rwxrwx--- oracle:root Custom Base Images --fromImageProperties When specifying --fromImage to override the default base image, Image Tool needs additional information about the image that is being provided, such as the installed operating system and version. By default, the additional information is gathered automatically by the Image Tool using docker run. If it is desirable to provide that additional information manually and avoid the docker run step, --fromImageProperties must be provided with the additional information using a Java Properties file. The file must be a line-oriented format with key-value pairs separated by =. For example:\npackageManager=MICRODNF __OS__ID=\"ol\" __OS__VERSION=\"8.10\" Required properties:\nKey Description Default packageManager The name of the installed package manager in the fromImage in all CAPS. Like DNF, MICRODNF, and YUM YUM __OS__ID The ID value found in /etc/os-release. Like “ol” for Oracle Linux, or “bb” for BusyBox. __OS__VERSION The VERSION value found in /etc/os-release. Like “8.10”. Additional properties:\nKey Description javaHome The location where the JDK is pre-installed. Like “/u01/jdk”. __OS__arch The output of uname -m. Like amd64 or arm64. --wdtVersion As of version 1.11.0, you may opt to install WDT and the model files in separate images. By default, the cached wdt_latest version of WDT is installed in the Auxiliary image with the selected models, archives, and variable files. If you use --wdtVersion=none (case insensitive), the auxiliary image will be created without installing WDT.\nUse an argument file You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.\nFor example, create a file called build_args:\ncreateAuxImage --tag mydomain:1 --wdtModel ./my_domain.yaml --wdtArchive ./my_domain.zip Use it on the command line, as follows:\n$ imagetool @/path/to/build_args Usage scenarios The following commands assume that the required WDT installer has been downloaded and added to the ImageTool cache. Use the cache command to set it up.\nCreate an image named wdt:1.10 with the latest WebLogic Deploy Tooling version.\n$ imagetool createAuxImage --tag wdt:1.10 Create an image named mydomain:1 with the same options as above and add a WDT model and archive.\n$ imagetool create --tag mydomain:1 --wdtModel /path/to/my_domain.yaml --wdtArchive /path/to/my_domain.zip",

When supplying user, you must supply the password either as an environment variable using --passwordEnv, or as a file using --passwordFile, or interactively, on the command line with --password. --version Installer version. 14.1.2.0.0 Additional information --additionalBuildCommands This is an advanced option that let’s you provide additional commands to the Docker build step.\nThe input for this parameter is a simple text file that contains one or more of the valid sections. Valid sections for rebase:\nSection Available Variables Build Stage Timing initial-build-commands None All As root, and before any Image Tool actions. before-jdk-install JAVA_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) Before the JDK is installed. after-jdk-install JAVA_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) After the JDK is installed. before-fmw-install JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) Before the Oracle Home is created. after-fmw-install JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) After all of the Oracle middleware installers are finished. final-build-commands JAVA_HOME ORACLE_HOME DOMAIN_HOME Final image After all Image Tool actions are complete, and just before the container image is finalized. NOTE: Changes made in intermediate stages may not be carried forward to the final image unless copied manually.\nThe Image Tool will copy the Java Home and the Oracle Home directories to the final image.\nChanges fully contained within these directories do not need an additional COPY command in the final-build-commands section.

Or, if the file needs to change the Oracle Home prior to domain creation, use the after-fmw-install or before-wdt-command sections.\n--target By default, the generated WLS domain in your image will use the best practices defined by Oracle WebLogic Server.\nThe target option allows you to toggle the defaults so that the generated domain is easier to use in the target environment. For example, the --target OpenShift option will change the file permissions in the domain directory so that the group permissions match the user permissions.\nTarget Default File Permissions Default File Ownership Default rwxr-x--- oracle:oracle OpenShift rwxrwx--- oracle:root Use an argument file You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.\nFor example, create a file called build_args:\nrebase --tag wls:141200 --sourceImage wls:141100 --version 14.1.2.0.0 --jdkVersion 21.0.6 Use it on the command line, as follows:\n$ imagetool @/path/to/build_args Usage scenarios Note: Use --passwordEnv or --passwordFile instead of --password.\nThe commands below assume that all the required JDK, WLS, or FMW (WebLogic infrastructure) installers have been downloaded to the cache directory.

If you see dangling images after the build (images labeled as \u003cnone\u003e), use the following command to remove them:\n$ docker rmi $(docker images --filter \"dangling=true\" -q --no-trunc) If you wish to keep the Docker context directory and/or the intermediate images, using the --skipcleanup flag will skip the delete steps. Some older versions of Docker do not support the prune command used by the Image Tool. As a temporary workaround, --skipcleanup can be used to skip the prune command until you are able to upgrade to a newer version of Docker.",

But, the following environment variables are provided for non-typical use cases when the default values are insufficient.\nEnvironment variables WLSIMG_BLDDIR - During the build process, Image Tool creates a Docker context directory where it will create a Dockerfile and copy necessary files for the container image build. Setting this variable to another directory overrides the default of the user’s home directory as the parent folder of the Docker context directory. WLSIMG_BUILDER - As an alternative to the command-line argument --builder, this variable can be used to override the tool to process the Dockerfile (such asdocker or podman). The provided value should be the full path to the executable. For example, WLSIMG_BUILDER=\"/usr/bin/docker\". WLSIMG_CACHEDIR - When Image Tool downloads patches, those patches are saved in the cache directory. Setting this variable to another directory overrides the default of the cache folder in the user’s home directory. WLSIMG_OS_PACKAGES - There are several packages and libraries that are required by the WebLogic Kubernetes Toolkit. The default packages included at build time are gzip tar unzip libaio libnsl jq findutils diffutils. The names for those libraries can be different depending on your preferred Linux distribution or OS version. The value that you provide in this environment variable will be used in place of the default package list.",
