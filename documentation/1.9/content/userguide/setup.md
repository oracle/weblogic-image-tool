- Download and unzip the WIT release ZIP file to a desired location.
- OPTIONALLY: You may build the project (`mvn clean package`) to create the ZIP installer in `./imagetool/target`.
- Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the location of the Java install (see [Prerequisites]({{< relref "/userguide/prerequisites.md" >}})).
