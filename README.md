# Oracle WebLogic Image Tool

as is taking over the software world. In this modern age of software development, Docker and Kubernetes
have become the gold standard. To help customers stay at the forefront of this, Oracle has released the
[WebLogic Server Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-kubernetes-operator). The operator helps
customers move their workloads to the cloud via the Kubernetes (cloud neutral) route. Customers get to decide how
to create the Docker images and apply patches to these images deployed by the Kubernetes operator. To help them
with this effort, we have created the [WebLogic Image Tool](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-image-tool).

## Features of the Oracle WebLogic Image Tool

The Oracle WebLogic Image Tool can create a WebLogic Docker image from any base image (for example, Oracle Linux, Ubuntu), install a given version of
WebLogic (for example, 12.2.1.3.0), install a given JDK (for example, 8u202), apply selected patches, and create a domain with a given
version of [WDT](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling). The tool can also update a Docker image either
created using this tool or a Docker image built by the user (you should have an `ORACLE_HOME` `env` variable defined by
applying selected patches).

## Prerequisites

- Active Internet connection. The tool needs to communicate with Oracle support system.
- Oracle support credentials. These are used to validate and download patches.
- WebLogic and JDK installers from OTN / e-delivery. These should be available on local disk.
- Docker client and daemon on the build machine.
- Bash version 4.0 or higher to enable `<tab>` command complete feature

## Setup

- Build the project (`mvn clean package`) to generate artifacts `imagetool-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip`.
- Unzip to a desired location. This action should create lib, bin directories and LICENSE.txt.
- If running an OS with bash, run `cd your_unzipped_location/bin` and `source setup.sh`.
- On Windows, set up with `imagetool.cmd` or the `imagetool.bat` script:
    ```cmd
    @ECHO OFF
    java -cp "your_unzipped_folder/lib" com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.cli.CLIDriver %*
    ```
- Then, execute `imagetool help` to get the help screen.
- You can execute the JAR directly using the command `java -cp "your_unzipped_folder/lib" com.oracle.weblogic.imagetool.cli.CLIDriver help`.
- After you are familiar with the commands, you will be able to create and update WebLogic Docker images.
