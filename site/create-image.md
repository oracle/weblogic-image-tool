## Additional information

#### `--additionalBuildCommands`

This is an advanced option that let's you provide additional commands to the Docker build step.  
The input for this parameter is a simple text file that contains one or more of the valid sections. Valid sections for create:

| Section | Build Stage | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `before-jdk-install` | Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) | Before the JDK is installed. |
| `after-jdk-install` | Intermediate (JDK_BUILD) | After the JDK is installed. |
| `before-fmw-install` | Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) | Before the Oracle Home is created. |
| `after-fmw-install` | Intermediate (WLS_BUILD) | After all of the Oracle middleware installers are finished. |
| `before-wdt-command` | Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) | Before WDT is installed. |
| `after-wdt-command` | Intermediate (WDT_BUILD) | After WDT domain creation/update is complete. |
| `final-build-commands` | Final image | After all Image Tool actions are complete, and just before the Docker image is finalized. |

NOTE: Changes made in intermediate stages may not be carried forward to the final image unless copied manually.  
The Image Tool will copy the Java Home, Oracle Home, domain home, and WDT home directories to the final image.  
Changes fully contained within these directories do not need an additional `COPY` command in the `final-build-commands` section.

Each section can contain one or more valid Dockerfile commands and would look like the following:

```dockerfile
[after-fmw-install]
RUN rm /some/dir/unnecessary-file
COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/my_additional_file.txt /u01

[final-build-commands]
LABEL owner="middleware team"
```

#### `--additionalBuildFiles`

This option provides a way to supply additional files to the image build command.
All provided files and directories are copied directly under the `files` subfolder of the build context.  
To get those files into the image, additional build commands must be provided using the `additionalBuildCommands` options.
Access to these files using a build command, such as `COPY` or `ADD`, should use the original filename 
with the folder prefix, `files/`.  For example, if the 
original file was provided as `--additionalBuildFiles /scratch/test1/convenience.sh`, the Docker build command `COPY`
provided in `--additionalBuildCommands` should look like 
`COPY --chown=oracle:oracle files/convenience.sh /my/internal/image/location`.  
Because Image Tool uses multi-stage 
builds, it is important to place the build command (like `COPY`) in the appropriate section of the `Dockerfile` based
on when the build needs access to the file.  For example, if the file is needed in the final image and not for 
installation or domain creation steps, use the `final-build-commands` section so that the `COPY` command occurs in the 
final stage of the image build.  Or, if the file needs to change the Oracle Home prior to domain creation, use 
the `after-fmw-install` or `before-wdt-command` sections.

#### Use an argument file

You can save all arguments passed for the Image Tool in a file, then use the file as a parameter.

For example, create a file called `build_args`:

```bash
create
--type wls
--version 12.2.1.3.0
--tag wls:122130
--user acmeuser@mycompany.com
--httpProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80
--httpsProxyUrl http://mycompany-proxy:80
--passwordEnv MYPWD

```

Use it on the command line, as follows:

```bash
imagetool @/path/to/build_args
```


## Usage scenarios

**Note**: Use `--passwordEnv` or `--passwordFile` instead of `--password`.

The commands below assume that all the required JDK, WLS, or FMW (WebLogic infrastructure installers) have been downloaded
 to the cache directory. Use the [cache](cache.md) command to set it up.

- Create an image named `sample:wls` with the WebLogic installer 12.2.1.3.0, server JDK 8u202, and latest PSU applied.
    ```
    imagetool create --tag sample:wls --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello
    ```

- Create an image named `sample:wdt` with the same options as above and create a domain with [WebLogic Deploy Tooling](https://github.com/oracle/weblogic-deploy-tooling).
    ```
    imagetool create --tag sample:wdt --latestPSU --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --wdtModel /path/to/model.json --wdtVariables /path/to/variables.json --wdtVersion 0.16
    ```
    If `wdtVersion` is not provided, the tool uses the latest release.

- Create an image named `sample:patch` with the selected patches applied.
    ```
    imagetool create --tag sample:patch --user testuser@xyz.com --password hello --patches 12345678,p87654321
    ```
    The patch numbers may or may not start with '`p`'.
