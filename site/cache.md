# Cache

The Image Tool maintains a local file cache store, this store is used to look up where the Java,
WebLogic installers, and WebLogic patches reside in the local file system.
                                                                         
By default, it is stored in the user's ```$HOME/cache``` directory.  Under this directory, the lookup information is
stored in the file ```.metadata```.  All automatically downloaded patches also reside in this directory.  
                                                                         
This default cache store location can be changed by setting the environment variable WLSIMG_CACHEDIR

The `cache` command can be used to manipulate the local file cache. There are several subcommands of the cache feature:

```
Usage: imagetool cache [COMMAND]
List and set cache options

Commands:

  listItems     List cache contents
  addInstaller  Add cache entry for wls, fmw, jdk or wdt installer
  addPatch      Add cache entry for wls|fmw patch or psu
  addEntry      Command to add a cache entry. Use caution
  deleteEntry   Command to delete a cache entry
  help          Displays help information about the specified command
```

## Usage scenarios

- `listItems`: Display the contents of the cache. Displays key value pairs of the installers and patches.
    ```
    imagetool cache listItems

    Cache contents
    jdk_8u202=/home/acmeuser/Downloads/cache/server-jre-8u202-linux-x64.tar.gz
    wls_12.2.1.3.0=/home/acmeuser/Downloads/cache/fmw_12.2.1.3.0_wls_Disk1_1of1.zip
    28186730_opatch=/home/acmeuser/cache/p28186730_139400_Generic.zip
    29135930_12.2.1.3.190416=/home/acmeuser/cache/p29135930_12213190416_Generic.zip
    29135930_12.2.1.3.0=/home/acmeuser/cache/p29135930_122130_Generic.zip
    cache.dir=/home/acemeuser/cache
    ```

- `addInstaller`: Add an installer to the cache, for example, JDK.
    ```
    imagetool cache addInstaller --type jdk --version 8u202 --path /path/to/local/jdk.tar.gz
    ```

- `addPatch`: Add a patch to the cache. This command verifies if the path points to a valid patch by querying the Oracle support portal.
    ```
    imagetool cache addPatch --type wls --patchId 12345678_12.2.1.3.0 --path /path/to/patch.zip
    ```
Note:  When adding a patch to the cache store. The patchId should be in the following format:  99999999_9.9.9.9.99999  The first 8 digits is the patch id, followed by an underscore and then release number.  This is needed if you want to distinguish a patch that has different versions of the patch.  

For example, patch 29135930 has several different versions from Oracle support, one for each release where the bug is fixed.

| Patch Name | Release |
| ---------|---------|
| 29135930 | 12.2.1.3.190416|
| 29135930 | 12.2.1.3.0 |
| 29135930 | 12.2.1.3.18106 |

If you have downloaded the release version ```12.2.1.3.190416``` of the patch, then you should use the argument as ```--patchId 29135930_12.2.1.3.190416```

- `addEntry`: Consider this an expert mode where you can add key value pairs to the cache without any validation.
    ```
    imagetool cache addEntry --key xyz_123 --value /path/to/file
    ```

- `deleteEntry`: Delete an entry from the cache for a given key. **Note**: This command does not delete files from the disk.
    ```
    imagetool cache deleteEntry --key xyz_123
    ```
